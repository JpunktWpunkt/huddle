## Overview
### The challenge
My challenge was to build a preview card component and got it looking as close to the design as possible.
I used Next.js and Vercel.
Goals/ User should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

I learned to use the design and make ist responsive depending the device screen.
Also I used hover and focus states for interactive elements
